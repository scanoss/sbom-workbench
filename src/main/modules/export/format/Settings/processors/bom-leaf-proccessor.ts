     * 2. If the node is ignored (ignored > identified), it's marked for removal
     * 3. If the node's identified PURL matches its matched PURL, it's included
     * 4. If the PURLs differ, a replacement setting is generated
     *
     * The resulting settings object will contain arrays for:
     * - remove: Components to be removed from processing
     * - include: Components to be explicitly included
     * - replace: Components whose PURL should be replaced
     *
     * @param node The leaf node to process
