## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+
- NPM (Node Packages Manager)

We strongly recommend handling your node versions using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Install

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
Please note that you should include the `--legacy-peer-deps` parameter in the installation command. This is because `@mui/styles` is not compatible with React 18. You can find more information about this at [https://mui.com/system/styles/basics/](https://mui.com/system/styles/basics/).

### Troubleshooting

SBOM Workbench uses [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) to compile SQLite3 native module.
This module uses "node-pre-gyp" to download the prebuilt binary for your platform instead you need build from source.
In case it does not exist for your platform, node-gyp going to build it.

Depending on your operating system, you will need prepare the correct environment to run node-gyp: See [https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
npm start
```

For live reloading you can use `npm run start --watch` to run the app using [Electronmon](https://github.com/catdad/electronmon#readme). Warning: this tool has a high memory consumption.

## Packaging for Production

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
npm run package
```

## Multi-language (i18n)

SBOM Workbench is multi-language enabled. To contribute a new language please see our [internationalization documentation](assets/i18n/README.md).

## Workbench Configuration
SBOM Workbench support advanced settings. All the configurations needs to be included in the global config file `~/.scanoss/sbom-workbench-settings.json`

### Scanner parameters

`"SCANNER_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT": "<integer>"`
Number of threads to use while scanning (optional - default 5)

`"SCANNER_POST_SIZE": "<intenger>"`
Number of kilobytes to limit the post to while scanning (optional - default 16)

`"SCANNER_TIMEOUT": "<integer>"`
Timeout (in seconds) for API communication (optional - default 300)

### Proxy settings
You might need to specify proxy settings depending on how your network is configured

`"PROXY": "<proxy_ip_address>:<proxy_port>"`

If your network is using a proxy with SSL interception you can include your certificate in the configuration
